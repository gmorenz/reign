    = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
    = note: the following traits define an item `drop`, perhaps you need to implement one of them:
            candidate #1: `Drop`
            candidate #2: `UnsafeFutureObj`
            candidate #3: `pin_project::__private::PinnedDrop`
            candidate #4: `pin_project::__private::PinnedDrop`
